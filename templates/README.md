# templates usage

Use `topic-template.md` to start a new topic:
1. Copy to `topics/<your-topic>.md`.
2. Fill sections 1–5 only (goal, 5 functions, 3–5 chunks, skeleton, 1 upgrade pair) on day 0.
3. Keep raw unprocessed material separate in a `*-raw-handout.md` file if needed.

`topic-example-packing.md` shows a finished state (after several loops).

> Old path `topics/_topic-template.md` is deprecated; use this directory instead. A compatibility stub can be added if muscle memory requires it temporarily.
