1. 听 Emma 和 Tom 聊他们在过去旅游中所经历过的 “文化冲击”，并思考你是否有同样的经历。

   Emma: Have you ever experienced a culture shock (文化冲击) while traveling?

   Tom: Definitely! Last year I went to Europe (欧洲), and it was a bit surprising. I thought everything would be super convenient (便利的) because it’s a developed region (发达地区).

   Emma: Really? What happened?

   Tom: Well, in China, we have super fast delivery (快递，外卖等送货服务) and mobile payments (移动支付) almost everywhere. But in Europe, sometimes I had to pay with cash (现金), and food delivery (外卖) wasn’t as easy or affordable (划算的). Public transport can also be a bit inconvenient (不便的).

   Emma: Oh, I see. I also had a culture shock in Southeast Asia (东南亚). I thought countries like Vietnam (越南) or Thailand (泰国) would be less developed.

   Tom: And were they?

   Emma: Not at all! Many cities are modern (现代化的) and very urban (城市的，城市化的). People speak English quite well, even better than in some East Asian (东亚的) countries. I was really impressed (印象深刻的，钦佩的).

3. Practice 练习

   尝试回答问题:

   Have you ever experienced culture shock?

   你是否有经历过文化冲击？

   Example Answer 示例答案:

   Yes, I have. I went to the United States a couple of years ago (几年前). At first, I was surprised because people usually do not take off their shoes (脱鞋子) at home. Sometimes they even wear shoes on the bed! It felt a little strange, but I got used to (习惯) it after a while because every place has its own culture, and we should respect it.
